The dataset "Fuel Consumption Ratings 2023," from Kaggle, provides comprehensive insights into vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. 
It has several variables that help understand automotive efficiency and environmental impact. 
The dataset has been curated to remove redundant information, such as converting combined fuel consumption to miles per gallon (mpg). 
With 833 rows, this dataset provides a comprehensive overview of vehicles and their associated attributes.
My goal was to use these variables to predict CO2 emissions and fuel ratings of different types of vehicles to get an idea of which cars are better for the environment.
