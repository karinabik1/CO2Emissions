The dataset "Fuel Consumption Ratings 2023," from Kaggle, provides comprehensive insights into vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. 
It encompasses several variables crucial for understanding automotive efficiency and environmental impact. 
These variables include the year of manufacture, vehicle make and model, engine specifications such as size and cylinder count, transmission type, fuel type, the amount of fuel consumed per 100 kilometers driven (in L/100 km), fuel consumption rates for highway (in L/100 km), fuel consumption rates for combined driving (in both L/100 km and mpg), CO2 emissions per kilometer, and CO2 and smog ratings, which are both assigned based on its emissions level. 
Notably, the dataset has been curated to remove redundant information, such as converting combined fuel consumption to miles per gallon (mpg). 
With 833 rows, this dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various vehicles and their associated attributes.
